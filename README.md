# 🕵️‍♂️ CTF OSINT Toolkit

Welcome to the **CTF OSINT Toolkit** by [cse-osint2k25](https://github.com/cse-osint2k25).

This isn’t just a list of tools. It’s a map — and those who follow it carefully may discover more than just links and tips.  
There are trails, clues, and perhaps... secrets only visible to those who know where (and how) to look. 🔍

## 🎈 A Strange Thread Appeared...

They say every digital trail begins with a whisper — and sometimes a scream.  

Late one night, a curious user stumbled on this repo after Googling  
**"abandoned circus domains darknet email leaks"**.

It was quiet at first. Just a folder. A README. Some tools. Nothing unusual.  

But then... a file changed.

No commit. No author.

Just a line — added out of nowhere:

> *"come find me... we all float in the cloud now..."*  

And below it, tucked between two dead markdown links, was this:


### 📧 Email & Breach Lookups
   it.floats.red@protonmail.com
   
### 📎 Metadata & File Analysis
- `exiftool`, `strings`, `binwalk` – the usual suspects.

Was it bait? A joke?  
Some said it responded — others said their IPs were logged and reversed.

## 🧠 CTF Players, OSINT Hunters — This Is Your Playground

Tools lie here. But so do stories, clues, and strange footprints from accounts that don’t exist anymore.

You’re not just here to browse. You’re here to dig.

🎯 *Find the trails. Trace the metadata. De-obfuscate the rest.*

There are no balloons in this repo. But there might be echoes.
